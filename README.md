# Edmeda

Web-based remote communication & collaboration is an increasingly important subject, not only for companies, but also for Schools, especially in times of Covid-19, but also to teach team work and digital literacies.

With that in mind, Edmeda was created.

Edmeda is a password protected MERN-Stack Web Application which enables Schools to communicate & collaborate easily and effectively via multiple Communities. To achieve that, Teachers, Students and Parents alike are equipped with real-time Group Chats to share information instantaneously and effortlessly. Using Edmeda, Teachers can create limitless Communities - and inside those communities, a limitless number of user groups. Those Communities and their User Groups can be centered around any target audience or subject, thus enabling users to achieve a targeted communication and information exchange, even in times of Corona.
 
Edmeda is geared towards usability, so that all main tasks can be accomplished without leaving the current screen. Teachers have the ability to administer both communities and their users seamlessly right where it's needed, in the communities interface - without the need to dig through big and scary admin areas first, that tend to be apps of their own. The gender of newly registered Users is automatically recognized based on the first name - and User Avatars are assigned randomly based on user type and gender. Teachers can effortlessly create Communities of various types (e.g. Class-, Course- or Custom-Communities) and within those communities Student-, Parent and fellow Teacher-Accounts. By opening a community,   they have access to its user groups and chats. Alongside default user groups, that are targeted to communicate with specific user groups, each community can have an infinite number of custom user groups, that can be dedicated to arbitrary school subjects, projects, activities, events etc. - thus enabling the members to communicate and collaborate efficiently as a team!
